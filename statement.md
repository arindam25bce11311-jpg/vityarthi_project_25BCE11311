1. Problem Statement
Manual tracking methods like paper logs lead to data loss and missed harvests due to a lack of simple, accessible digital tools for farmers.

2. Scope of the Project
The project entails developing a standalone Python command-line application for managing crop lifecycles using local CSV storage without external dependencies.

3. Target Users
Primary users include small-scale farmers, hobbyist gardeners, and farm managers requiring an offline, low-resource digital solution.

4. High-Level Features
Key features include crop scheduling, a digital logbook for viewing records, inventory deletion capabilities, and automatic local data persistence.
